    <h2>Ryan Walker</h2>
    <h2>Ryeguy</h2>
    <p>Greetings! My name is Ryan Walker. I am 21 years old. I am on my second sememster at BYU-I. I served a mission in the Utah Provo Mission from 2019-2021. I have two older sisters who both attended BYU-I. They are now both graduated and married. No neices or nephews yet, but one of them is fostering!</p>
    <p>Quick backstory regarding my nicknmae. I don't actaully go by Ryeguy, but that's what my grandparents called me, and it kind of stuck. Now, only a few members of my family actually call me by my nickname.</p>
    <p>I have an interest in cyber security. I believe that is the career I am going to pursue after I graduate. I also have a great interest in computers and technology. I really enjoy programming, as well.</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is 2 Nephi 27:23: "For behold, I am God; and I am a God of amiracles; and I will show unto the bworld that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and I cwork not among the children of men save it be daccording to their faith." Miracles have not ceased, but they require faith.</p>
