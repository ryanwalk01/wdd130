            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>My name is Ryan Walker. I was born and raised in West Virginia. I am from a town called Parkersburg; a peaceful place seated alongside the lengthy Ohio River. I am from a family of five. I have two older sisters and both are married. I have fantastic parents, both of which work with special needs students. I am currently attending Brigham Young University as a freshman. I am studying Computer Information Technology, as I greatly enjoy working and tinkering with computers. However, I have a great love photography, as well. </p>

            <h2>Why I love photography</h2>
            <p>Taking pictures is one of my favorite hobbies. Being able to capture a moment in time, and then sharing that moment with others is an amazing experience. It allows people to learn and see things from a different perspective. I cherish taking a good picture and admiring it with others. I also love it when others are able to do the same.</p>
