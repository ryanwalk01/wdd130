      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I enjoy photography. 
        I like taking pictures of scenery and all of earth's beauty. 
        I have taken pictures of everywhere I've traveled, like the rolling hills of West Virginia and the sandy beaches of Florida. 
        Do you find enjoyment out of admiring the great outdoors as much as I do? Fortunately, I love sharing the pictures that I take with others. I take the time to make sure that all the pictures I share are pleasant to look at. My website will have many spectacular images that will inspire your inner desire to explore.

        My Work<br>
        I have taken pictures at many locations across the United States. In the state of New York, I have photographed New York City and Niagara Falls. I also have taken plenty of pictures on the beaches of Virginia. I have taken pictures in Florida, the sunshine state, including beaches and grand resorts. I have captured many of the spectacular hills of West Virginia. Finally, I have taken photographs of several places in Utah, where I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. These locations include, Provo, Price, Heber City, and Vernal. I have future plans to travel to even more locations around the world to continue to capture our magnificent earth. <br>
        With all that out of the way, enjoy the wonderful pictures of earth's beauty. <br>
